IBUN KATHIR ISLAMIC SCHOOL
### Parental Consent for Wearing School Uniform

Subject: 
Dear Parents/Guardians,
This is to inform all parents that students are required to wear the official school uniform when starting school. We kindly ask all parents to ensure that their children come to school in the prescribed uniform from the first day of attendance.
Please sign the consent form provided by the class teacher to confirm your approval for your child to wear the school uniform.
Thank you for your cooperation.
