### Parent–Teacher Association (PTA) Meeting
Date: 25/01/2026

All parents and guardians are kindly informed that the Parent–Teacher Association (PTA) Meeting will be held on Saturday, 25th January 2026 at 10:00 AM in the School Hall. Your presence is highly important and strongly encouraged.

The purpose of this meeting is to strengthen the collaboration between parents and the school in order to enhance the academic, moral, and social development of our students. During the session, teachers will provide updates on students’ performance, classroom activities, discipline, and general school progress. Parents will also have the opportunity to interact directly with teachers to discuss their child’s strengths and areas that may need improvement.

Important matters such as upcoming examinations, co-curricular programs, school policies, and planned educational projects for the term will be discussed. Suggestions and constructive feedback from parents regarding school development will be warmly welcomed. This meeting will also serve as a platform to collectively share ideas that can contribute to a better learning environment and student success.

Additionally, announcements will be made regarding new initiatives and improvements to support both academic and character development. Parents will be briefed on ways to support learning at home, promote good behavior, and encourage responsibility among students. A Q&A session will be included to address any concerns or clarifications parents may have.

In view of the above, all parents are requested to attend punctually and participate actively, as the decisions made during the meeting will benefit your child’s educational journey. We look forward to your full cooperation and meaningful contribution.

Attendance is **important**.
